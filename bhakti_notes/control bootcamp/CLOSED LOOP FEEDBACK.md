## Why feedback??
1. Uncertainty - we can cancel out the factor of uncertainty
2. Disturbances - we can take into account the disturbances and correct the error
3. Efficient - less energy required since we know the outcome to previous try
4. Instability - it changes the dynamic matrix of the system. so basically an unstable system can be turned into a stable one
