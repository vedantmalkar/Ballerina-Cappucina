[31mCMake Error at /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/sdformat9/sdformat9-targets.cmake:90 (message):
  The imported target "sdformat9::sdformat9" references the file

     "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsdformat9.so.9.10.1"

  but this file does not exist.  Possible reasons include:

  * The file was deleted, renamed, or moved to another location.

  * An install or uninstall procedure did not complete successfully.

  * The installation package was faulty and contained

     "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/sdformat9/sdformat9-targets.cmake"

  but not all the files it references.
