## Introduction
- Understood the different types of control systems, like active and passive.
- Active is further divided into open looped and closed looped systems.

Space State differential equations are represented as:
x'=Ax, where x is a vector denoting all quantities of interest.

The closed loops system is also known as feedback loop, as the output is analyzed, changes are made and the input is further updated. 
#### It has 4 main advantages:
- Uncertainty
- Instability
- Disturbances
- Efficiency

The feedback system has one major advantage, it changes the inherent stability of the system, showing it as 
x'=Ax+Bu, where u is like the control knob, and B is how the changes we make will change x and its derivatives. 

Basically, a brief overview to control systems, why the feedback loop system is so important and useful.
