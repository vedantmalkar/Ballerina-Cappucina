## Project Description:

Ballerina Cappucina, a graceful omnidirectional robot with a critical mission. This project brings her to life by designing and building a robot that can autonomously glide across a “dance floor,” identify scattered colorful “bombs” (balls), and scoop them up with precision.

A custom omnidirectional mobile base is created that allows for fluid movement, and a vision system using OpenCV for color detection. By implementing PID control, we ensure the robot navigates smoothly and accurately. Integrating these systems we enable Ballerina Cappucina to autonomously seek, collect, and sort the objects, clearing the stage.
